# Todo sample app based on React and other cutting age technologies

## Description

This is a quick show off what technologies used in front-end development. Todo app was chosen because of everyone familiar with it. It doesn't take much time to read through sources. Visual style taken from [local-todos](http://backbonejs.org/docs/todos.html) Backbone sample. Beyond React+Reduce+Webpack usage you can find here: testing, localization, persistence layer support, validation, per-component styling, undo implementation.
